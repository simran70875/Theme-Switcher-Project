# Theme Switcher Project

## Project Overview

This project is a React.js application built with TypeScript, designed to demonstrate how to implement multiple themes using styled components. The application allows users to switch between different color themes—light, dark, blue, and purple—across the entire application. The design components are styled using the Chakra UI library, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to showcase how to create a dynamic and customizable theme system in a React application. By providing multiple theme options, users can personalize their experience, which is particularly useful in modern web applications. This project also demonstrates how to integrate Chakra UI with styled components for consistent theming.

## Features

- **Multiple Themes**: Users can switch between light, dark, blue, and purple themes.
- **User Authentication**: Includes fully designed login, signup, and forgot password pages.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A responsive and interactive admin dashboard is included to demonstrate the application's functionality under different themes.
- **Styled Components**: Themes are implemented using styled components, ensuring modularity and reusability.
- **Chakra UI**: Utilizes Chakra UI for component styling, making it easy to build accessible and responsive UIs.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Styled Components**: A library for styling React components using tagged template literals.
